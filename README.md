Here is my capstone project that uses more than 1M data samples in customer analytics to find out the retention and satisfaction solutions for ride-hailing giants such as Uber and Lyft.

### Dataset:

**Uber-Lyft Dataset:** [Kaggle - Uber and Lyft Dataset (Boston, MA)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brllrb/uber-and-lyft-dataset-boston-ma)

This dataset shows ride-hailing information in Boston, MA, so we can study customer characteristics and categorize customers based on their riding habits. They include ride details, prices, and the numerous other crucial attributes of the ride-sharing services.

Our objective is to determine different segments based on their ride patterns and behaviors and create business strategies to help ride companies with the increase in customers. Our primary goal is to help ride companies with the business logic and marketing strategies to achieve the target.

## Customer Segmentation Strategies

We categorize customers using different segmentation approaches to uncover specific trends, such as:
- **Time of Day**
- **Day of the Week**
- **Common Pick-Up and Drop-Off Locations**
- **Cab Types (Uber, Lyft)**
- **Travel Distances (short, medium, long)**


##### This segmentation will help businesses to create appropriate customer loyalty solutions and enhance the services offered by ride-sharing services.

### Segmentation Types

1. **Time Segment:**
â€¢ It will fetch information about hour of the day, whether the customer is a Morning commuter or an Evening commuter


2. **Day segment:**
â€¢ It will fetch information about a day of the week, whether the customer commuting on weekdays or weekdays for school or work

3. **Source Segment:**
It will identify common pick-up locations so that in the future we can do overshare for people who live nearby locations while going to work and school.

4. **Destination Segement:**
â€¢ It will identify common drop-off locations so that in the future, We can do ubershare for people who live nearby locations while coming back from the
workplace or from the university.

5. **Cab Segment:**
â€¢ This segmentation is based on the cab type, just to see how many people like to commute by Lyft and Uber.
â€¢ when we understand these preferences it will be easy for a particular company with the
offers and discounts and it will help to add on more marketing strategies to gain more
customers.

6. **Distance Segment:**
â€¢ This segmentation groups the distance from the source to the destination for each
customer, it will help to decide short, mid, and long-distance riders.

3. **Machine Learning Models**
   - Models Tested:
     - **Random Forest Regressor**
     - **Linear Regression**
     - **XGBoost**
    
4. **Model Evaluation and Selection**

   - Evaluation Metrics: MAE, MSE, R-squared

   - Both Random Forest and XGBoost yielded strong results, with comparable accuracy.
   - **Random Forest Regressor** was selected as the final model due to its accuracy and stability.

## Summary and Recommendations

The patterns of ride behaviors detected in the Uber and Lyft dataset include the timing of commutation, the choice of the pickup/drop location, and the Uber/Lyft split. More specific market segments are morning and evening rush hour travelers, weekend travelers, short-distance travelers, and long-distance travelers.:

- **Targeted Marketing:** Create appealing campaigns depending on the dividing users into some groups; for instance, offering special offers for weekend trippers or bonuses for early morning rush-hour travelers.
- **Service Optimization:** To reduce delay during peak hours and in crowded stations, there should be an optimization of the fleet circulation.
- **Dynamic Pricing:** Make sure pricing and revenue strategies use demand patterns to continue to maintain and maximize the income from customers.
-  **Customer Loyalty Programs:** Implement a system to give incentives to regular commuters and customers in order to encourage them to stick around. They can help to enhance customer acquisition and business effectiveness with
